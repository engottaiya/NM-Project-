# Transforming Health Care with AI-Powered Disease Prediction

This project aims to revolutionize healthcare through the power of artificial intelligence. By leveraging patient data, we can build predictive models that assist in early diagnosis and disease prevention.

## Features

- Predict diseases using patient medical records
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Trained AI/ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Deep Learning)
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Pandas & NumPy
- Flask (for API deployment - optional)
- Streamlit / Gradio (for frontend interface - optional)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gnanesh/ai-disease-prediction.git
   cd ai-disease-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

## Data

You can use public datasets such as:
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Diabetes](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes)
- [Kaggle Medical Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
